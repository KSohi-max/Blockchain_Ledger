# Blockchain_Ledger

This analysis guilds a blockchain-based ledger system including a user-friendly web interface. This ledger allows partner banks to conduct financial transactions (that is, to transfer money between senders and receivers) and to verify the integrity of the data in the ledger.

Following steps were taken to update the script:

1. Created a new data class named Record. This class serves as the template for the financial transaction records that the blocks of the ledger will store.
2. Changed the existing Block data class by replacing the generic data attribute with a record attribute thatâ€™s of type Record.
3. Create additional user input areas in the Streamlit application. These input areas collect the relevant information for each financial record stored in the PyChain ledger.
4. Tested completed PyChain ledger.
